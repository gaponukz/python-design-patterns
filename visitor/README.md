# Visitor
is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate.
The Visitor interface declares a set of visiting methods that can take concrete elements of an object structure as arguments. These methods may have the same names if the program is written in a language that supports overloading, but the type of their parameters must be different.
